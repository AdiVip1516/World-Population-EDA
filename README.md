# World-Population-EDA

In demographics, the term World Population is often used to refer to the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have exceeded 7.9 billion as of November 2021. It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion. The global population is still increasing, but there is significant uncertainty about its long-term trajectory due to changing rates of fertility and mortality.

The total number of births globally is currently (2015â€“20) 140 million/year, is projected to peak during the period 2040-45 at 141 million/year and thereafter decline slowly to 126 million/year by 2100. The total number of deaths is currently 57 million/year and is projected to grow steadily to 121 million/year by 2100. The median age of human beings as of 2020 is 31 years.

Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.64 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, China and India, together constitute about 36% of the world's population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1.34 billion people, or 17% of the world's population.

In the attached Notebook, EDA is done of World Population dataset recorded from 1970 to 2022, obtained from Kaggle.
